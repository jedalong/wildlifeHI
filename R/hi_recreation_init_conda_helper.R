#' @title Conda environment helper
#'
#' @description
#'  The function, `hi_recreation_init_conda_helper()`, creates the appropriate Python environment for the user in miniconda. If the user does not have miniconda installed, it handles this too. 
#'
#' @details
#'  Using `hi_recreation_init_conda_helper()` may require administrator privileges. It creates a conda environment with a specified environment name using an environment.yml file that is included with the package. If miniconda is not downloaded, it will install miniconda. This can take some time.
#'  
#' @param env_name string; the name you want to use for the environment.
#' 
#' @return
#'  This function returns the environment name.
#'
#' @examples
#' \dontrun{
#' envName <- hi_recreation_init_conda_helper(env_name = 'hi_rec')
#' }
#' 
#' @export
